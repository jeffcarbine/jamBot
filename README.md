JamBot project

JamBot is a project for a one-stop jam website. Jam as in music, not... not jelly. Though that would be nice.

Anyway, I often try to tune my guitar and find chords and find metronomes online and I am usually bounced back from one site to another and another and another and they are all really ugly and hard to use. So, I figured that I should put all three of those things - metronome, instrumnet tuner, chord charts - in one easy-to-find place that is simple, organized and pleasing.

Aaaaaand that's it.
